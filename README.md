A password generator

This application has three files: index.html, style.css and script.js.

Index.html describes the headings people read indicating that this is a password generator. It also has the display box for the generated password, and a button for the user to click to begin the password generation process.

Style.css adds colors and spacing to the HTML to make it more readable.

Script.js contains the code that first prompts the user upon button-click to input how long they wish the password to be in characters. It tells user to choose a number between 8 and 128. If user fails, it will choose 30 for the user and notify user.

Then through a series of four prompts, the application asks user if they wish to include Special Characters, Numerics, Lowercase letters and Uppercase letters in the password. If the user says "no" to all four, all types of characters will be decided for the user, and user will be notified.

The application will then determine a random string of characters from the types selected and at the length selected. This password will then be displayed in the display box.
